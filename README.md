## Pre-Requisites
These steps were previously done on my laptop
1. Create a git account
2. Install Git

## Steps Performed
1. Download and install IntelliJ IDEA 2023.2.2 (Ultimate Edition)
2. Create new project using Sprint Initializr generator
3. Create local repo and commit initial 
4. Create new private repo in my personal space and set as origin for local repo
5. Create the README.md file (ie. this file) and start documenting the tasks
6. Add dependencies for testng, rest-assured, assertj, junit to the pom
7. Create New file APITest.java and copy skeleton from instructions. 

Note: There were a few issues that needed fixing
* text pasted into the PDF went a bit funny in places 
* the appended > after defining the baseURI
* the assertion from JUnit needed it's input parameters to be re-arranged to `assertEquals(msg,expected,actual)`
